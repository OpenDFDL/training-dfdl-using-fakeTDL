# DFDL Training for Owl CDS Users

This repository contains a number of labs that provide a gradual
introduction to DFDL schema authoring and debugging.

The training lessons use a simple binary data format called "fakeTDL",
the specification of which is provided herein.

A DFDL schema for fakeTDL is built up over the lab lessons and
training lectures.

The only tool used is the Daffodil Command Line Interface.
